# Refactor1x1
##search engine optimization
This is my first homework project.
I am motivated to assist with differently abled accessibilities.
I utilized refactoring skills by updating code to semantic elements.
I updated CSS with the styling properties associated with the updated HTML.
The title is updated with a description
The first block linked added id tag so when you tap on it you goes to the bottom of screen as all the other icons.
The image elements have alt attributes
I learned that I did not ask enough questions and to use different resources.
I used YouTube, w3, w3 accessibility, and tutoring.
This project is an attempt to satisfy all clients requests.
